# Sensors Actuators 

## Introduction
This repository contains some basic sensors I have tested and practiced with Arduino and Esp32 during my projects and in my leisure time. Those are the basic codes for each sensor. And I detailed those sensors. All these contents are simplified for understanding not complicated as it's on examples of libraries.
